                        <p>a. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the&nbsp;<strong>“DMCA”</strong>) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Service infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send RigUp a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:</p>
                        <p>i. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;</p>
                        <p>ii. Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of those works);</p>
                        <p>iii. Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow RigUp to locate the material on the Service;</p>
                        <p>iv. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);</p>
                        <p>v. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
                        <p>vi. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
                        <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send RigUp a counter-notice.</p>
                        <p>b. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA, see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Service should be sent to 98 San Jacinto Blvd, Suite 550, Austin, TX 78701 or copyright@rigup.com. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
                        <p>c. Repeat Infringers.&nbsp;RigUp will promptly terminate without notice the accounts of users that are determined by RigUp to be Repeat Infringers. A&nbsp;<strong>“Repeat Infringer”</strong>&nbsp;is a user who has been notified of infringing activity or has had User Content removed from the Service at least twice.</p>

Governing Law.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and RigUp agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Travis County, Texas for the purpose of litigating any dispute.

                        <p><strong>24. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></p>
                        <p>a. Generally.&nbsp;In the interest of resolving disputes between you and RigUp in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and RigUp agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND RIGUP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
                        <p>b. Exceptions.&nbsp;Despite the provisions of Section 24.a., nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
                        <p>c. Arbitrator.&nbsp;Any arbitration between you and RigUp will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,&nbsp;<strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) of the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting RigUp.</p>
                        <p>d. Notice; Process.&nbsp;A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (<strong>“Notice”</strong>). RigUp’s address for Notice is: RigUp, Inc., 98 San Jacinto Blvd, Suite 550, Austin, TX 78701. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (<strong>“Demand”</strong>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or RigUp may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or RigUp must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, RigUp will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by RigUp in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.</p>
                        <p>e. Fees.&nbsp;If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, RigUp will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Travis County, Texas but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse RigUp for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
                        <p>f. No Class Actions.&nbsp;YOU AND RIGUP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and RigUp agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
                        <p>g. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.&nbsp;If RigUp makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to RigUp’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to RigUp’s address for Notice, in which case your account with RigUp will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
                        <p>h. Enforceability.&nbsp;The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. If Section 24.f. is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24 will be null and void, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect in accordance with Section 26, and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 23 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

Notice Regarding Apple.</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and RigUp only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for any App or the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to any App. In the event of any failure of any App to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price for the relevant App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to any App. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to any App or your possession and/or use of any App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that any App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third party claim that any App or your possession and use of any App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights. You will comply with any applicable third party terms, when using any App. Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this section of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this section of these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. If RigUp provides a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English version will prevail.</p>

General.</strong>&nbsp;You may not assign these Terms or any of the rights or licenses granted under these Terms, directly or indirectly, including by sale, merger, change of control, operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of RigUp. RigUp may assign these Terms, including all its rights under these Terms, without restriction. These Terms, together with any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and RigUp regarding your use of and access to the Service, and, except as expressly permitted above, may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS WILL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.
